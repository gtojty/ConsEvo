Codes for Consonant Evolution in Duoxu due to contact between SWM and Lizu

This folder contains the codes ConsEvo.py and AllRes.r to do the simulations and statistical analyses for this study. In this study, we examined the evolution of consonants in Duoxu language during contact between SWM and Lizu. The results were published in a submission to Language Dynamics and Change.
